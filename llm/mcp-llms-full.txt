# Core architecture

Understand how MCP connects clients, servers, and LLMs

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is built on a flexible, extensible architecture that enables seamless communication between LLM applications and integrations. This document covers the core architectural components and concepts.

## Overview

MCP follows a client-server architecture where:

*   **Hosts** are LLM applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that initiate connections
*   **Clients** maintain 1:1 connections with servers, inside the host application
*   **Servers** provide context, tools, and prompts to clients

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "&nbsp;Host (e.g., Claude Desktop)&nbsp;"
        client1[MCP Client]
        client2[MCP Client]
    end
    subgraph "Server Process"
        server1[MCP Server]
    end
    subgraph "Server Process"
        server2[MCP Server]
    end

    client1 <-->|Transport Layer| server1
    client2 <-->|Transport Layer| server2
```

## Core components

### Protocol layer

The protocol layer handles message framing, request/response linking, and high-level communication patterns.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    class Protocol<Request, Notification, Result> {
        // Handle incoming requests
        setRequestHandler<T>(schema: T, handler: (request: T, extra: RequestHandlerExtra) => Promise<Result>): void

        // Handle incoming notifications
        setNotificationHandler<T>(schema: T, handler: (notification: T) => Promise<void>): void

        // Send requests and await responses
        request<T>(request: Request, schema: T, options?: RequestOptions): Promise<T>

        // Send one-way notifications
        notification(notification: Notification): Promise<void>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    class Session(BaseSession[RequestT, NotificationT, ResultT]):
        async def send_request(
            self,
            request: RequestT,
            result_type: type[Result]
        ) -> Result:
            """
            Send request and wait for response. Raises McpError if response contains error.
            """
            # Request handling implementation

        async def send_notification(
            self,
            notification: NotificationT
        ) -> None:
            """Send one-way notification that doesn't expect response."""
            # Notification handling implementation

        async def _received_request(
            self,
            responder: RequestResponder[ReceiveRequestT, ResultT]
        ) -> None:
            """Handle incoming request from other side."""
            # Request handling implementation

        async def _received_notification(
            self,
            notification: ReceiveNotificationT
        ) -> None:
            """Handle incoming notification from other side."""
            # Notification handling implementation
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Key classes include:

*   `Protocol`
*   `Client`
*   `Server`

### Transport layer

The transport layer handles the actual communication between clients and servers. MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms:

1.  **Stdio transport**
    *   Uses standard input/output for communication
    *   Ideal for local processes

2.  **HTTP with SSE transport**
    *   Uses Server-Sent Events for server-to-client messages
    *   HTTP POST for client-to-server messages

All transports use [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 to exchange messages. See the [specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io) for detailed information about the Model Context Protocol message format.

### Message types

MCP has these main types of messages:

1.  **Requests** expect a response from the other side:
    ```typescript
    interface Request {
      method: string;
      params?: { ... };
    }
    ```

2.  **Notifications** are one-way messages that don't expect a response:
    ```typescript
    interface Notification {
      method: string;
      params?: { ... };
    }
    ```

3.  **Results** are successful responses to requests:
    ```typescript
    interface Result {
      [key: string]: unknown;
    }
    ```

4.  **Errors** indicate that a request failed:
    ```typescript
    interface Error {
      code: number;
      message: string;
      data?: unknown;
    }
    ```

## Connection lifecycle

### 1. Initialization

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: initialize request
    Server->>Client: initialize response
    Client->>Server: initialized notification

    Note over Client,Server: Connection ready for use
```

1.  Client sends `initialize` request with protocol version and capabilities
2.  Server responds with its protocol version and capabilities
3.  Client sends `initialized` notification as acknowledgment
4.  Normal message exchange begins

### 2. Message exchange

After initialization, the following patterns are supported:

*   **Request-Response**: Client or server sends requests, the other responds
*   **Notifications**: Either party sends one-way messages

### 3. Termination

Either party can terminate the connection:

*   Clean shutdown via `close()`
*   Transport disconnection
*   Error conditions

## Error handling

MCP defines these standard error codes:

```typescript
enum ErrorCode {
  // Standard JSON-RPC error codes
  ParseError = -32700,
  InvalidRequest = -32600,
  MethodNotFound = -32601,
  InvalidParams = -32602,
  InternalError = -32603
}
```

SDKs and applications can define their own error codes above -32000.

Errors are propagated through:

*   Error responses to requests
*   Error events on transports
*   Protocol-level error handlers

## Implementation example

Here's a basic example of implementing an MCP server:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";
    import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

    const server = new Server({
      name: "example-server",
      version: "1.0.0"
    }, {
      capabilities: {
        resources: {}
      }
    });

    // Handle requests
    server.setRequestHandler(ListResourcesRequestSchema, async () => {
      return {
        resources: [
          {
            uri: "example://resource",
            name: "Example Resource"
          }
        ]
      };
    });

    // Connect transport
    const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
    await server.connect(transport);
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    import asyncio
    import mcp.types as types
    from mcp.server import Server
    from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server

    app = Server("example-server")

    @app.list_resources()
    async def list_resources() -> list[types.Resource]:
        return [
            types.Resource(
                uri="example://resource",
                name="Example Resource"
            )
        ]

    async def main():
        async with stdio_server() as streams:
            await app.run(
                streams[0],
                streams[1],
                app.create_initialization_options()
            )

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best practices

# Prompts

Create reusable prompt templates and workflows

Prompts enable servers to define reusable prompt templates and workflows that clients can easily surface to users and LLMs. They provide a powerful way to standardize and share common LLM interactions.

<Note>
  Prompts are designed to be **user-controlled**, meaning they are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the user being able to explicitly select them for use.
</Note>

## Overview

Prompts in MCP are predefined templates that can:

*   Accept dynamic arguments
*   Include context from resources
*   Chain multiple interactions
*   Guide specific workflows
*   Surface as UI elements (like slash commands)

## Prompt structure

Each prompt is defined with:

```typescript
{
  name: string;              // Unique identifier for the prompt
  description?: string;      // Human-readable description
  arguments?: [              // Optional list of arguments
    {
      name: string;          // Argument identifier
      description?: string;  // Argument description
      required?: boolean;    // Whether argument is required
    }
  ]
}
```

## Discovering prompts

Clients can discover available prompts through the `prompts/list` endpoint:

```typescript
// Request
{
  method: "prompts/list"
}

// Response
{
  prompts: [
    {
      name: "analyze-code",
      description: "Analyze code for potential improvements",
      arguments: [
        {
          name: "language",
          description: "Programming language",
          required: true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using prompts

To use a prompt, clients make a `prompts/get` request:

````typescript
// Request
{
  method: "prompts/get",
  params: {
    name: "analyze-code",
    arguments: {
      language: "python"
    }
  }
}

// Response
{
  description: "Analyze Python code for potential improvements",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: {
        type: "text",
        text: "Please analyze the following Python code for potential improvements:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        total = total + num\n    return total\n\nresult = calculate_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nprint(result)\n```"
      }
    }
  ]
}
````

## Dynamic prompts

Prompts can be dynamic and include:

### Embedded resource context

```json
{
  "name": "analyze-project",
  "description": "Analyze project logs and code",
  "arguments": [
    {
      "name": "timeframe",
      "description": "Time period to analyze logs",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "name": "fileUri",
      "description": "URI of code file to review",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

When handling the `prompts/get` request:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Analyze these system logs and the code file for any issues:"
      }
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": {
        "type": "resource",
        "resource": {
          "uri": "logs://recent?timeframe=1h",
          "text": "[2024-03-14 15:32:11] ERROR: Connection timeout in network.py:127\n[2024-03-14 15:32:15] WARN: Retrying connection (attempt 2/3)\n[2024-03-14 15:32:20] ERROR: Max retries exceeded",
          "mimeType": "text/plain"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": {
        "type": "resource",
        "resource": {
          "uri": "file:///path/to/code.py",
          "text": "def connect_to_service(timeout=30):\n    retries = 3\n    for attempt in range(retries):\n        try:\n            return establish_connection(timeout)\n        except TimeoutError:\n            if attempt == retries - 1:\n                raise\n            time.sleep(5)\n\ndef establish_connection(timeout):\n    # Connection implementation\n    pass",
          "mimeType": "text/x-python"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Multi-step workflows

```typescript
const debugWorkflow = {
  name: "debug-error",
  async getMessages(error: string) {
    return [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: {
          type: "text",
          text: `Here's an error I'm seeing: ${error}`
        }
      },
      {
        role: "assistant",
        content: {
          type: "text",
          text: "I'll help analyze this error. What have you tried so far?"
        }
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: {
          type: "text",
          text: "I've tried restarting the service, but the error persists."
        }
      }
    ];
  }
};
```

        ]
      }
    };

    const server = new Server({
      name: "example-prompts-server",
      version: "1.0.0"
    }, {
      capabilities: {
        prompts: {}
      }

    server.setRequestHandler(ListPromptsRequestSchema, async () => {
      return {
        prompts: Object.values(PROMPTS)
      };

## Best practices

When implementing prompts:

1.  Use clear, descriptive prompt names
2.  Provide detailed descriptions for prompts and arguments
3.  Validate all required arguments
4.  Handle missing arguments gracefully
5.  Consider versioning for prompt templates
6.  Cache dynamic content when appropriate
7.  Implement error handling
8.  Document expected argument formats
9.  Consider prompt composability
10. Test prompts with various inputs

## UI integration

Prompts can be surfaced in client UIs as:

*   Slash commands
*   Quick actions
*   Context menu items
*   Command palette entries
*   Guided workflows
*   Interactive forms

## Updates and changes

Servers can notify clients about prompt changes:

1.  Server capability: `prompts.listChanged`
2.  Notification: `notifications/prompts/list_changed`
3.  Client re-fetches prompt list

## Security considerations

When implementing prompts:

*   Validate all arguments
*   Sanitize user input
*   Consider rate limiting
*   Implement access controls
*   Audit prompt usage
*   Handle sensitive data appropriately
*   Validate generated content
*   Implement timeouts
*   Consider prompt injection risks
*   Document security requirements


# Resources

Expose data and content from your servers to LLMs

Resources are a core primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allow servers to expose data and content that can be read by clients and used as context for LLM interactions.

<Note>
  Resources are designed to be **application-controlled**, meaning that the client application can decide how and when they should be used.
  Different MCP clients may handle resources differently. For example:

  *   Claude Desktop currently requires users to explicitly select resources before they can be used
  *   Other clients might automatically select resources based on heuristics
  *   Some implementations may even allow the AI model itself to determine which resources to use

  Server authors should be prepared to handle any of these interaction patterns when implementing resource support. In order to expose data to models automatically, server authors should use a **model-controlled** primitive such as [Tools](./tools).
</Note>

## Overview

Resources represent any kind of data that an MCP server wants to make available to clients. This can include:

*   File contents
*   Database records
*   API responses
*   Live system data
*   Screenshots and images
*   Log files
*   And more

Each resource is identified by a unique URI and can contain either text or binary data.

## Resource URIs

Resources are identified using URIs that follow this format:

```
[protocol]://[host]/[path]
```

For example:

*   `file:///home/user/documents/report.pdf`
*   `postgres://database/customers/schema`
*   `screen://localhost/display1`

The protocol and path structure is defined by the MCP server implementation. Servers can define their own custom URI schemes.

## Resource types

Resources can contain two types of content:

### Text resources

Text resources contain UTF-8 encoded text data. These are suitable for:

*   Source code
*   Configuration files
*   Log files
*   JSON/XML data
*   Plain text

### Binary resources

Binary resources contain raw binary data encoded in base64. These are suitable for:

*   Images
*   PDFs
*   Audio files
*   Video files
*   Other non-text formats

## Resource discovery

Clients can discover available resources through two main methods:

### Direct resources

Servers expose a list of concrete resources via the `resources/list` endpoint. Each resource includes:

```typescript
{
  uri: string;           // Unique identifier for the resource
  name: string;          // Human-readable name
  description?: string;  // Optional description
  mimeType?: string;     // Optional MIME type
}
```

### Resource templates

For dynamic resources, servers can expose [URI templates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570) that clients can use to construct valid resource URIs:

```typescript
{
  uriTemplate: string;   // URI template following RFC 6570
  name: string;          // Human-readable name for this type
  description?: string;  // Optional description
  mimeType?: string;     // Optional MIME type for all matching resources
}
```

## Reading resources

To read a resource, clients make a `resources/read` request with the resource URI.

The server responds with a list of resource contents:

```typescript
{
  contents: [
    {
      uri: string;        // The URI of the resource
      mimeType?: string;  // Optional MIME type

      // One of:
      text?: string;      // For text resources
      blob?: string;      // For binary resources (base64 encoded)
    }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
  Servers may return multiple resources in response to one `resources/read` request. This could be used, for example, to return a list of files inside a directory when the directory is read.
</Tip>

## Resource updates

MCP supports real-time updates for resources through two mechanisms:

### List changes

Servers can notify clients when their list of available resources changes via the `notifications/resources/list_changed` notification.

### Content changes

Clients can subscribe to updates for specific resources:

1.  Client sends `resources/subscribe` with resource URI
2.  Server sends `notifications/resources/updated` when the resource changes
3.  Client can fetch latest content with `resources/read`
4.  Client can unsubscribe with `resources/unsubscribe`

## Example implementation

Here's a simple example of implementing resource support in an MCP server:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    const server = new Server({
      name: "example-server",
      version: "1.0.0"
    }, {
      capabilities: {
        resources: {}
      }
    });

    // List available resources
    server.setRequestHandler(ListResourcesRequestSchema, async () => {
      return {
        resources: [
          {
            uri: "file:///logs/app.log",
            name: "Application Logs",
            mimeType: "text/plain"
          }
        ]
      };
    });

    // Read resource contents
    server.setRequestHandler(ReadResourceRequestSchema, async (request) => {
      const uri = request.params.uri;

      if (uri === "file:///logs/app.log") {
        const logContents = await readLogFile();
        return {
          contents: [
            {
              uri,
              mimeType: "text/plain",
              text: logContents
            }
          ]
        };
      }

      throw new Error("Resource not found");
    });
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    app = Server("example-server")

    @app.list_resources()
    async def list_resources() -> list[types.Resource]:
        return [
            types.Resource(
                uri="file:///logs/app.log",
                name="Application Logs",
                mimeType="text/plain"
            )

        if str(uri) == "file:///logs/app.log":
            log_contents = await read_log_file()
            return log_contents

        raise ValueError("Resource not found")

    # Start server
    async with stdio_server() as streams:
        await app.run(
            streams[0],
            streams[1],
            app.create_initialization_options()
        )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best practices

When implementing resource support:

1.  Use clear, descriptive resource names and URIs
2.  Include helpful descriptions to guide LLM understanding
3.  Set appropriate MIME types when known
4.  Implement resource templates for dynamic content
5.  Use subscriptions for frequently changing resources
6.  Handle errors gracefully with clear error messages
7.  Consider pagination for large resource lists
8.  Cache resource contents when appropriate
9.  Validate URIs before processing
10. Document your custom URI schemes

## Security considerations

When exposing resources:

*   Validate all resource URIs
*   Implement appropriate access controls
*   Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
*   Be cautious with binary data handling
*   Consider rate limiting for resource reads
*   Audit resource access
*   Encrypt sensitive data in transit
*   Validate MIME types
*   Implement timeouts for long-running reads
*   Handle resource cleanup appropriately


# Sampling

Let your servers request completions from LLMs

Sampling is a powerful MCP feature that allows servers to request LLM completions through the client, enabling sophisticated agentic behaviors while maintaining security and privacy.

<Info>
  This feature of MCP is not yet supported in the Claude Desktop client.
</Info>

## How sampling works

The sampling flow follows these steps:

1.  Server sends a `sampling/createMessage` request to the client
2.  Client reviews the request and can modify it
3.  Client samples from an LLM
4.  Client reviews the completion
5.  Client returns the result to the server

This human-in-the-loop design ensures users maintain control over what the LLM sees and generates.

## Message format

Sampling requests use a standardized message format:

```typescript
{
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user" | "assistant",
      content: {
        type: "text" | "image",

        // For text:
        text?: string,

        // For images:
        data?: string,             // base64 encoded
        mimeType?: string
      }
    }
  ],
  modelPreferences?: {
    hints?: [{
      name?: string                // Suggested model name/family
    }],
    costPriority?: number,         // 0-1, importance of minimizing cost
    speedPriority?: number,        // 0-1, importance of low latency
    intelligencePriority?: number  // 0-1, importance of capabilities
  },
  systemPrompt?: string,
  includeContext?: "none" | "thisServer" | "allServers",
  temperature?: number,
  maxTokens: number,
  stopSequences?: string[],
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>
}
```

## Request parameters

### Messages

The `messages` array contains the conversation history to send to the LLM. Each message has:

*   `role`: Either "user" or "assistant"
*   `content`: The message content, which can be:
    *   Text content with a `text` field
    *   Image content with `data` (base64) and `mimeType` fields

### Model preferences

The `modelPreferences` object allows servers to specify their model selection preferences:

*   `hints`: Array of model name suggestions that clients can use to select an appropriate model:
    *   `name`: String that can match full or partial model names (e.g. "claude-3", "sonnet")
    *   Clients may map hints to equivalent models from different providers
    *   Multiple hints are evaluated in preference order

*   Priority values (0-1 normalized):
    *   `costPriority`: Importance of minimizing costs
    *   `speedPriority`: Importance of low latency response
    *   `intelligencePriority`: Importance of advanced model capabilities

Clients make the final model selection based on these preferences and their available models.

### System prompt

An optional `systemPrompt` field allows servers to request a specific system prompt. The client may modify or ignore this.

### Context inclusion

The `includeContext` parameter specifies what MCP context to include:

*   `"none"`: No additional context
*   `"thisServer"`: Include context from the requesting server
*   `"allServers"`: Include context from all connected MCP servers

The client controls what context is actually included.

### Sampling parameters

Fine-tune the LLM sampling with:

*   `temperature`: Controls randomness (0.0 to 1.0)
*   `maxTokens`: Maximum tokens to generate
*   `stopSequences`: Array of sequences that stop generation
*   `metadata`: Additional provider-specific parameters

## Response format

The client returns a completion result:

```typescript
{
  model: string,  // Name of the model used
  stopReason?: "endTurn" | "stopSequence" | "maxTokens" | string,
  role: "user" | "assistant",
  content: {
    type: "text" | "image",
    text?: string,
    data?: string,
    mimeType?: string
  }
}
```

## Example request

Here's an example of requesting sampling from a client:

```json
{
  "method": "sampling/createMessage",
  "params": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What files are in the current directory?"
        }
      }
    ],
    "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful file system assistant.",
    "includeContext": "thisServer",
    "maxTokens": 100
  }
}
```

## Best practices

When implementing sampling:

1.  Always provide clear, well-structured prompts
2.  Handle both text and image content appropriately
3.  Set reasonable token limits
4.  Include relevant context through `includeContext`
5.  Validate responses before using them
6.  Handle errors gracefully
7.  Consider rate limiting sampling requests
8.  Document expected sampling behavior
9.  Test with various model parameters
10. Monitor sampling costs

## Human in the loop controls

Sampling is designed with human oversight in mind:

### For prompts

*   Clients should show users the proposed prompt
*   Users should be able to modify or reject prompts
*   System prompts can be filtered or modified
*   Context inclusion is controlled by the client

### For completions

*   Clients should show users the completion
*   Users should be able to modify or reject completions
*   Clients can filter or modify completions
*   Users control which model is used

## Security considerations

When implementing sampling:

*   Validate all message content
*   Sanitize sensitive information
*   Implement appropriate rate limits
*   Monitor sampling usage
*   Encrypt data in transit
*   Handle user data privacy
*   Audit sampling requests
*   Control cost exposure
*   Implement timeouts
*   Handle model errors gracefully

## Common patterns

### Agentic workflows

Sampling enables agentic patterns like:

*   Reading and analyzing resources
*   Making decisions based on context
*   Generating structured data
*   Handling multi-step tasks
*   Providing interactive assistance

### Context management

Best practices for context:

*   Request minimal necessary context
*   Structure context clearly
*   Handle context size limits
*   Update context as needed
*   Clean up stale context

### Error handling

Robust error handling should:

*   Catch sampling failures
*   Handle timeout errors
*   Manage rate limits
*   Validate responses
*   Provide fallback behaviors
*   Log errors appropriately

## Limitations

Be aware of these limitations:

*   Sampling depends on client capabilities
*   Users control sampling behavior
*   Context size has limits
*   Rate limits may apply
*   Costs should be considered
*   Model availability varies
*   Response times vary
*   Not all content types supported


# Tools

Enable LLMs to perform actions through your server

Tools are a powerful primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enable servers to expose executable functionality to clients. Through tools, LLMs can interact with external systems, perform computations, and take actions in the real world.

<Note>
  Tools are designed to be **model-controlled**, meaning that tools are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the AI model being able to automatically invoke them (with a human in the loop to grant approval).
</Note>

## Overview

Tools in MCP allow servers to expose executable functions that can be invoked by clients and used by LLMs to perform actions. Key aspects of tools include:

*   **Discovery**: Clients can list available tools through the `tools/list` endpoint
*   **Invocation**: Tools are called using the `tools/call` endpoint, where servers perform the requested operation and return results
*   **Flexibility**: Tools can range from simple calculations to complex API interactions

Like [resources](/docs/concepts/resources), tools are identified by unique names and can include descriptions to guide their usage. However, unlike resources, tools represent dynamic operations that can modify state or interact with external systems.

## Tool definition structure

Each tool is defined with the following structure:

```typescript
{
  name: string;          // Unique identifier for the tool
  description?: string;  // Human-readable description
  inputSchema: {         // JSON Schema for the tool's parameters
    type: "object",
    properties: { ... }  // Tool-specific parameters
  }
}
```

## Implementing tools

Here's an example of implementing a basic tool in an MCP server:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    const server = new Server({
      name: "example-server",
      version: "1.0.0"
    }, {
      capabilities: {
        tools: {}
      }
    });

    // Define available tools
    server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {
      return {
        tools: [{
          name: "calculate_sum",
          description: "Add two numbers together",
          inputSchema: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
              a: { type: "number" },
              b: { type: "number" }
            },
            required: ["a", "b"]
          }
        }]
      };
    });

    // Handle tool execution
    server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {
      if (request.params.name === "calculate_sum") {
        const { a, b } = request.params.arguments;
        return {
          toolResult: a + b
        };
      }
      throw new Error("Tool not found");
    });
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    app = Server("example-server")

    @app.list_tools()
    async def list_tools() -> list[types.Tool]:
        return [
            types.Tool(
                name="calculate_sum",
                description="Add two numbers together",
                inputSchema={
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "a": {"type": "number"},
                        "b": {"type": "number"}
                    },
                    "required": ["a", "b"]
                }
            )
        ]

    @app.call_tool()
    async def call_tool(
        name: str,
        arguments: dict
    ) -> list[types.TextContent | types.ImageContent | types.EmbeddedResource]:
        if name == "calculate_sum":
            a = arguments["a"]
            b = arguments["b"]
            result = a + b
            return [types.TextContent(type="text", text=str(result))]
        raise ValueError(f"Tool not found: {name}")
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Example tool patterns

Here are some examples of types of tools that a server could provide:

### System operations

Tools that interact with the local system:

```typescript
{
  name: "execute_command",
  description: "Run a shell command",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      command: { type: "string" },
      args: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } }
    }
  }
}
```

### API integrations

Tools that wrap external APIs:

```typescript
{
  name: "github_create_issue",
  description: "Create a GitHub issue",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      title: { type: "string" },
      body: { type: "string" },
      labels: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } }
    }
  }
}
```

### Data processing

Tools that transform or analyze data:

```typescript
{
  name: "analyze_csv",
  description: "Analyze a CSV file",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      filepath: { type: "string" },
      operations: {
        type: "array",
        items: {
          enum: ["sum", "average", "count"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Best practices

When implementing tools:

1.  Provide clear, descriptive names and descriptions
2.  Use detailed JSON Schema definitions for parameters
3.  Include examples in tool descriptions to demonstrate how the model should use them
4.  Implement proper error handling and validation
5.  Use progress reporting for long operations
6.  Keep tool operations focused and atomic
7.  Document expected return value structures
8.  Implement proper timeouts
9.  Consider rate limiting for resource-intensive operations
10. Log tool usage for debugging and monitoring

## Security considerations

When exposing tools:

### Input validation

*   Validate all parameters against the schema
*   Sanitize file paths and system commands
*   Validate URLs and external identifiers
*   Check parameter sizes and ranges
*   Prevent command injection

### Access control

*   Implement authentication where needed
*   Use appropriate authorization checks
*   Audit tool usage
*   Rate limit requests
*   Monitor for abuse

### Error handling

*   Don't expose internal errors to clients
*   Log security-relevant errors
*   Handle timeouts appropriately
*   Clean up resources after errors
*   Validate return values

## Tool discovery and updates

MCP supports dynamic tool discovery:

1.  Clients can list available tools at any time
2.  Servers can notify clients when tools change using `notifications/tools/list_changed`
3.  Tools can be added or removed during runtime
4.  Tool definitions can be updated (though this should be done carefully)

## Error handling

Tool errors should be reported within the result object, not as MCP protocol-level errors. This allows the LLM to see and potentially handle the error. When a tool encounters an error:

1.  Set `isError` to `true` in the result
2.  Include error details in the `content` array

Here's an example of proper error handling for tools:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    try {
      // Tool operation
      const result = performOperation();
      return {
        content: [
          {
            type: "text",
            text: `Operation successful: ${result}`
          }
        ]
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        isError: true,
        content: [
          {
            type: "text",
            text: `Error: ${error.message}`
          }
        ]
      };
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    try:
        # Tool operation
        result = perform_operation()
        return types.CallToolResult(
            content=[
                types.TextContent(
                    type="text",
                    text=f"Operation successful: {result}"
                )
            ]
        )
    except Exception as error:
        return types.CallToolResult(
            isError=True,
            content=[
                types.TextContent(
                    type="text",
                    text=f"Error: {str(error)}"
                )
            ]
        )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This approach allows the LLM to see that an error occurred and potentially take corrective action or request human intervention.

## Testing tools

A comprehensive testing strategy for MCP tools should cover:

*   **Functional testing**: Verify tools execute correctly with valid inputs and handle invalid inputs appropriately
*   **Integration testing**: Test tool interaction with external systems using both real and mocked dependencies
*   **Security testing**: Validate authentication, authorization, input sanitization, and rate limiting
*   **Performance testing**: Check behavior under load, timeout handling, and resource cleanup
*   **Error handling**: Ensure tools properly report errors through the MCP protocol and clean up resources


# Transports

Learn about MCP's communication mechanisms

Transports in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provide the foundation for communication between clients and servers. A transport handles the underlying mechanics of how messages are sent and received.

## Message Format

MCP uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 as its wire format. The transport layer is responsible for converting MCP protocol messages into JSON-RPC format for transmission and converting received JSON-RPC messages back into MCP protocol messages.

There are three types of JSON-RPC messages used:

### Requests

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  id: number | string,
  method: string,
  params?: object
}
```

### Responses

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  id: number | string,
  result?: object,
  error?: {
    code: number,
    message: string,
    data?: unknown
  }
}
```

### Notifications

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0",
  method: string,
  params?: object
}
```

## Built-in Transport Types

MCP includes two standard transport implementations:

### Standard Input/Output (stdio)

The stdio transport enables communication through standard input and output streams. This is particularly useful for local integrations and command-line tools.

Use stdio when:

*   Building command-line tools
*   Implementing local integrations
*   Needing simple process communication
*   Working with shell scripts

        async with ClientSession(streams[0], streams[1]) as session:
            await session.initialize()
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)

SSE transport enables server-to-client streaming with HTTP POST requests for client-to-server communication.

Use SSE when:

*   Only server-to-client streaming is needed
*   Working with restricted networks
*   Implementing simple updates

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Custom Transports

MCP makes it easy to implement custom transports for specific needs. Any transport implementation just needs to conform to the Transport interface:

You can implement custom transports for:

*   Custom network protocols
*   Specialized communication channels
*   Integration with existing systems
*   Performance optimization

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    interface Transport {
      // Start processing messages
      start(): Promise<void>;

      // Send a JSON-RPC message
      send(message: JSONRPCMessage): Promise<void>;

      // Close the connection
      close(): Promise<void>;

      // Callbacks
      onclose?: () => void;
      onerror?: (error: Error) => void;
      onmessage?: (message: JSONRPCMessage) => void;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    Note that while MCP Servers are often implemented with asyncio, we recommend
    implementing low-level interfaces like transports with `anyio` for wider compatibility.

    ```python
    @contextmanager
    async def create_transport(
        read_stream: MemoryObjectReceiveStream[JSONRPCMessage | Exception],
        write_stream: MemoryObjectSendStream[JSONRPCMessage]
    ):
        """
        Transport interface for MCP.

        Args:
            read_stream: Stream to read incoming messages from
            write_stream: Stream to write outgoing messages to
        """
        async with anyio.create_task_group() as tg:
            try:
                # Start processing messages
                tg.start_soon(lambda: process_messages(read_stream))

                # Send messages
                async with write_stream:
                    yield write_stream

            except Exception as exc:
                # Handle errors
                raise exc
            finally:
                # Clean up
                tg.cancel_scope.cancel()
                await write_stream.aclose()
                await read_stream.aclose()
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Error Handling

Transport implementations should handle various error scenarios:

1.  Connection errors
2.  Message parsing errors
3.  Protocol errors
4.  Network timeouts
5.  Resource cleanup

Example error handling:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    class ExampleTransport implements Transport {
      async start() {
        try {
          // Connection logic
        } catch (error) {
          this.onerror?.(new Error(`Failed to connect: ${error}`));
          throw error;
        }
      }

      async send(message: JSONRPCMessage) {
        try {
          // Sending logic
        } catch (error) {
          this.onerror?.(new Error(`Failed to send message: ${error}`));
          throw error;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    Note that while MCP Servers are often implemented with asyncio, we recommend
    implementing low-level interfaces like transports with `anyio` for wider compatibility.

    ```python
    @contextmanager
    async def example_transport(scope: Scope, receive: Receive, send: Send):
        try:
            # Create streams for bidirectional communication
            read_stream_writer, read_stream = anyio.create_memory_object_stream(0)
            write_stream, write_stream_reader = anyio.create_memory_object_stream(0)

            async def message_handler():
                try:
                    async with read_stream_writer:
                        # Message handling logic
                        pass
                except Exception as exc:
                    logger.error(f"Failed to handle message: {exc}")
                    raise exc

            async with anyio.create_task_group() as tg:
                tg.start_soon(message_handler)
                try:
                    # Yield streams for communication
                    yield read_stream, write_stream
                except Exception as exc:
                    logger.error(f"Transport error: {exc}")
                    raise exc
                finally:
                    tg.cancel_scope.cancel()
                    await write_stream.aclose()
                    await read_stream.aclose()
        except Exception as exc:
            logger.error(f"Failed to initialize transport: {exc}")
            raise exc
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

When implementing or using MCP transport:

1.  Handle connection lifecycle properly
2.  Implement proper error handling
3.  Clean up resources on connection close
4.  Use appropriate timeouts
5.  Validate messages before sending
6.  Log transport events for debugging
7.  Implement reconnection logic when appropriate
8.  Handle backpressure in message queues
9.  Monitor connection health
10. Implement proper security measures

## Security Considerations

# Debugging

A comprehensive guide to debugging Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations

Effective debugging is essential when developing MCP servers or integrating them with applications. This guide covers the debugging tools and approaches available in the MCP ecosystem.

<Info>
  This guide is for macOS. Guides for other platforms are coming soon.
</Info>

## Debugging tools overview

MCP provides several tools for debugging at different levels:

1.  **MCP Inspector**
    *   Interactive debugging interface
    *   Direct server testing
    *   See the [Inspector guide](/docs/tools/inspector) for details

2.  **Claude Desktop Developer Tools**
    *   Integration testing
    *   Log collection
    *   Chrome DevTools integration

3.  **Server Logging**
    *   Custom logging implementations
    *   Error tracking
    *   Performance monitoring

## Debugging in Claude Desktop

### Checking server status

The Claude.app interface provides basic server status information:

1.  Click the <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/claude-desktop-mcp-plug-icon.svg" style={{display: 'inline', margin: 0, height: '1.3em'}} /> icon to view:
    *   Connected servers
    *   Available prompts and resources

2.  Click the <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/claude-desktop-mcp-hammer-icon.svg" style={{display: 'inline', margin: 0, height: '1.3em'}} /> icon to view:
    *   Tools made available to the model

### Viewing logs

Review detailed MCP logs from Claude Desktop:

```bash
# Follow logs in real-time
tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
```

The logs capture:

*   Server connection events
*   Configuration issues
*   Runtime errors
*   Message exchanges

### Using Chrome DevTools

Access Chrome's developer tools inside Claude Desktop to investigate client-side errors:

1.  Enable DevTools:

```bash
jq '.allowDevTools = true' ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/developer_settings.json > tmp.json \
  && mv tmp.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/developer_settings.json
```

2.  Open DevTools: `Command-Option-Shift-i`

Note: You'll see two DevTools windows:

*   Main content window
*   App title bar window

Use the Console panel to inspect client-side errors.

Use the Network panel to inspect:

*   Message payloads
*   Connection timing

## Common issues

### Environment variables

MCP servers inherit only a subset of environment variables automatically, like `USER`, `HOME`, and `PATH`.

To override the default variables or provide your own, you can specify an `env` key in `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "myserver": {
    "command": "mcp-server-myapp",
    "env": {
      "MYAPP_API_KEY": "some_key",
    }
  }
}
```

### Server initialization

Common initialization problems:

1.  **Path Issues**
    *   Incorrect server executable path
    *   Missing required files
    *   Permission problems

2.  **Configuration Errors**
    *   Invalid JSON syntax
    *   Missing required fields
    *   Type mismatches

3.  **Environment Problems**
    *   Missing environment variables
    *   Incorrect variable values
    *   Permission restrictions

### Connection problems

When servers fail to connect:

1.  Check Claude Desktop logs
2.  Verify server process is running
3.  Test standalone with [Inspector](/docs/tools/inspector)
4.  Verify protocol compatibility

## Implementing logging

### Server-side logging

When building a server that uses the local stdio [transport](/docs/concepts/transports), all messages logged to stderr (standard error) will be captured by the host application (e.g., Claude Desktop) automatically.

<Warning>
  Local MCP servers should not log messages to stdout (standard out), as this will interfere with protocol operation.
</Warning>

For all [transports](/docs/concepts/transports), you can also provide logging to the client by sending a log message notification:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    server.request_context.session.send_log_message(
      level="info",
      data="Server started successfully",
    )
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    server.sendLoggingMessage({
      level: "info",
      data: "Server started successfully",
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Important events to log:

*   Initialization steps
*   Resource access
*   Tool execution
*   Error conditions
*   Performance metrics

### Client-side logging

In client applications:

1.  Enable debug logging
2.  Monitor network traffic
3.  Track message exchanges
4.  Record error states

## Debugging workflow

### Development cycle

1.  Initial Development
    *   Use [Inspector](/docs/tools/inspector) for basic testing
    *   Implement core functionality
    *   Add logging points

2.  Integration Testing
    *   Test in Claude Desktop
    *   Monitor logs
    *   Check error handling

### Testing changes

To test changes efficiently:

*   **Configuration changes**: Restart Claude Desktop
*   **Server code changes**: Use Command-R to reload
*   **Quick iteration**: Use [Inspector](/docs/tools/inspector) during development

## Best practices

### Logging strategy

1.  **Structured Logging**
    *   Use consistent formats
    *   Include context
    *   Add timestamps
    *   Track request IDs

2.  **Error Handling**
    *   Log stack traces
    *   Include error context
    *   Track error patterns
    *   Monitor recovery

3.  **Performance Tracking**
    *   Log operation timing
    *   Monitor resource usage
    *   Track message sizes
    *   Measure latency

### Security considerations

When debugging:

1.  **Sensitive Data**
    *   Sanitize logs
    *   Protect credentials
    *   Mask personal information

2.  **Access Control**
    *   Verify permissions
    *   Check authentication
    *   Monitor access patterns

## Getting help

When encountering issues:

1.  **First Steps**
    *   Check server logs
    *   Test with [Inspector](/docs/tools/inspector)
    *   Review configuration
    *   Verify environment

2.  **Support Channels**
    *   GitHub issues
    *   GitHub discussions

3.  **Providing Information**
    *   Log excerpts
    *   Configuration files
    *   Steps to reproduce
    *   Environment details

# Inspector

In-depth guide to using the MCP Inspector for testing and debugging Model Context Protocol servers

The [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) is an interactive developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers. While the [Debugging Guide](/docs/tools/debugging) covers the Inspector as part of the overall debugging toolkit, this document provides a detailed exploration of the Inspector's features and capabilities.

## Getting started

### Installation and basic usage

The Inspector runs directly through `npx` without requiring installation:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <command>
```

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <command> <arg1> <arg2>
```

#### Inspecting servers from NPM or PyPi

A common way to start server packages from [NPM](https://npmjs.com) or [PyPi](https://pypi.com).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NPM package">
    ```bash
    npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx <package-name> <args>
    # For example
    npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx server-postgres postgres://127.0.0.1/testdb
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="PyPi package">
    ```bash
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx <package-name> <args>
    # For example
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-server-git --repository ~/code/mcp/servers.git
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Inspecting locally developed servers

To inspect servers locally developed or downloaded as a repository, the most common
way is:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```bash
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node path/to/server/index.js args...
    ```
  </Tab>

# Introduction

Get started with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Why MCP?

MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:

*   A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
*   The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
*   Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure

### General architecture

At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Your Computer"
        Host["MCP Host\n(Claude, IDEs, Tools)"]
        S1["MCP Server A"]
        S2["MCP Server B"]
        S3["MCP Server C"]
        Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S1
        Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S2
        Host <-->|"MCP Protocol"| S3
        S1 <--> D1[("Local\nData Source A")]
        S2 <--> D2[("Local\nData Source B")]
    end
    subgraph "Internet"
        S3 <-->|"Web APIs"| D3[("Remote\nService C")]
    end
```

*   **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
*   **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
*   **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
*   **Local Data Sources**: Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
*   **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

# Quickstart

Get started with building your first MCP server and connecting it to a host

In this tutorial, we'll build a simple MCP weather server and connect it to a host, Claude for Desktop. We'll start with a basic setup, and then progress to more complex use cases.

### What we'll be building

Many LLMs (including Claude) do not currently have the ability to fetch the forecast and severe weather alerts. Let's use MCP to solve that!

We'll build a server that exposes two tools: `get-alerts` and `get-forecast`. Then we'll connect the server to an MCP host (in this case, Claude for Desktop):

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/weather-alerts.png" />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/current-weather.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Servers can connect to any client. We've chosen Claude desktop here for simplicity, but we also have guides on [building your own client](/tutorials/building-a-client).
</Note>

<Accordion title="Why Claude for Desktop and not Claude.ai?">
  Because servers are locally run, MCP currently only supports desktop hosts. Remote hosts are in active development.
</Accordion>

### Core MCP Concepts

MCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities:

1.  **Resources**: File-like data that can be read by clients (like API responses or file contents)
2.  **Tools**: Functions that can be called by the LLM (with user approval)
3.  **Prompts**: Pre-written templates that help users accomplish specific tasks

This tutorial focuses on tools, but we have intermediate tutorials if you'd like to learn more about Resources and Prompts.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ### Prerequisite knowledge

    This quickstart assumes you have familiarity with:

    *   Python
    *   LLMs like Claude

    ### System requirements

    For Python, make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed.

    ### Set up your environment

    First, let's install `uv` and set up our Python project and environment:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash MacOS/Linux
      curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
      ```

      ```powershell Windows
      powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Make sure to restart your terminal afterwards to ensure that the `uv` command gets picked up.

    Now, let's create and set up our project:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash MacOS/Linux
      # Create a new directory for our project
      uv init weather
      cd weather

      # Create virtual environment and activate it
      uv venv
      source .venv/bin/activate

      # Install dependencies
      uv add mcp httpx 

      # Remove template file
      rm hello.py

      # Create our files
      mkdir -p src/weather
      touch src/weather/__init__.py
      touch src/weather/server.py
      ```

      ```powershell Windows
      # Create a new directory for our project
      uv init weather
      cd weather

      # Create virtual environment and activate it
      uv venv
      .venv\Scripts\activate

      # Install dependencies
      uv add mcp httpx

      # Clean up boilerplate code
      rm hello.py

      # Create our files
      md src
      md src\weather
      new-item src\weather\__init__.py
      new-item src\weather\server.py
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Add this code to `pyproject.toml`:

    ```toml
    ...rest of config

    [build-system]
    requires = [ "hatchling",]
    build-backend = "hatchling.build"

    [project.scripts]
    weather = "weather:main"
    ```

    Add this code to `__init__.py`:

    ```python src/weather/__init__.py
    from . import server
    import asyncio

    def main():
        """Main entry point for the package."""
        asyncio.run(server.main())

    # Optionally expose other important items at package level
    __all__ = ['main', 'server']
    ```

    Now let's dive into building your server.

    ## Building your server

    ### Importing packages

    Add these to the top of your `server.py`:

    ```python
    from typing import Any
    import asyncio
    import httpx
    from mcp.server.models import InitializationOptions
    import mcp.types as types
    from mcp.server import NotificationOptions, Server
    import mcp.server.stdio
    ```

    ### Setting up the instance

    Then initialize the server instance and the base URL for the NWS API:

    ```python
    NWS_API_BASE = "https://api.weather.gov"
    USER_AGENT = "weather-app/1.0"

    server = Server("weather")
    ```

    ### Implementing tool listing

    We need to tell clients what tools are available. The `list_tools()` decorator registers this handler:

    ```python
    @server.list_tools()
    async def handle_list_tools() -> list[types.Tool]:
        """
        List available tools.
        Each tool specifies its arguments using JSON Schema validation.
        """
        return [
            types.Tool(
                name="get-alerts",
                description="Get weather alerts for a state",
                inputSchema={
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "state": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "Two-letter state code (e.g. CA, NY)",
                        },
                    },
                    "required": ["state"],
                },
            ),
            types.Tool(
                name="get-forecast",
                description="Get weather forecast for a location",
                inputSchema={
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "latitude": {
                            "type": "number",
                            "description": "Latitude of the location",
                        },
                        "longitude": {
                            "type": "number",
                            "description": "Longitude of the location",
                        },
                    },
                    "required": ["latitude", "longitude"],
                },
            ),
        ]

    ```

    This defines our two tools: `get-alerts` and `get-forecast`.

    ### Helper functions

    Next, let's add our helper functions for querying and formatting the data from the National Weather Service API:

    ```python
    async def make_nws_request(client: httpx.AsyncClient, url: str) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
        """Make a request to the NWS API with proper error handling."""
        headers = {
            "User-Agent": USER_AGENT,
            "Accept": "application/geo+json"
        }

        try:
            response = await client.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=30.0)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()
        except Exception:
            return None

    def format_alert(feature: dict) -> str:
        """Format an alert feature into a concise string."""
        props = feature["properties"]
        return (
            f"Event: {props.get('event', 'Unknown')}\n"
            f"Area: {props.get('areaDesc', 'Unknown')}\n"
            f"Severity: {props.get('severity', 'Unknown')}\n"
            f"Status: {props.get('status', 'Unknown')}\n"
            f"Headline: {props.get('headline', 'No headline')}\n"
            "---"
        )
    ```

    ### Implementing tool execution

    The tool execution handler is responsible for actually executing the logic of each tool. Let's add it:

    ```python
    @server.call_tool()
    async def handle_call_tool(
        name: str, arguments: dict | None
    ) -> list[types.TextContent | types.ImageContent | types.EmbeddedResource]:
        """
        Handle tool execution requests.
        Tools can fetch weather data and notify clients of changes.
        """
        if not arguments:
            raise ValueError("Missing arguments")
      
        if name == "get-alerts":
            state = arguments.get("state")
            if not state:
                raise ValueError("Missing state parameter")

            # Convert state to uppercase to ensure consistent format
            state = state.upper()
            if len(state) != 2:
                raise ValueError("State must be a two-letter code (e.g. CA, NY)")

            async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                alerts_url = f"{NWS_API_BASE}/alerts?area={state}"
                alerts_data = await make_nws_request(client, alerts_url)

                if not alerts_data:
                    return [types.TextContent(type="text", text="Failed to retrieve alerts data")]

                features = alerts_data.get("features", [])
                if not features:
                    return [types.TextContent(type="text", text=f"No active alerts for {state}")]

                # Format each alert into a concise string
                formatted_alerts = [format_alert(feature) for feature in features[:20]] # only take the first 20 alerts
                alerts_text = f"Active alerts for {state}:\n\n" + "\n".join(formatted_alerts)

                return [
                    types.TextContent(
                        type="text",
                        text=alerts_text
                    )
                ]
        elif name == "get-forecast":
            try:
                latitude = float(arguments.get("latitude"))
                longitude = float(arguments.get("longitude"))
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                return [types.TextContent(
                    type="text",
                    text="Invalid coordinates. Please provide valid numbers for latitude and longitude."
                )]
                
            # Basic coordinate validation
            if not (-90 <= latitude <= 90) or not (-180 <= longitude <= 180):
                return [types.TextContent(
                    type="text",
                    text="Invalid coordinates. Latitude must be between -90 and 90, longitude between -180 and 180."
                )]

            async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                # First get the grid point
                lat_str = f"{latitude}"
                lon_str = f"{longitude}"
                points_url = f"{NWS_API_BASE}/points/{lat_str},{lon_str}"
                points_data = await make_nws_request(client, points_url)

                if not points_data:
                    return [types.TextContent(type="text", text=f"Failed to retrieve grid point data for coordinates: {latitude}, {longitude}. This location may not be supported by the NWS API (only US locations are supported).")]

                # Extract forecast URL from the response
                properties = points_data.get("properties", {})
                forecast_url = properties.get("forecast")
                
                if not forecast_url:
                    return [types.TextContent(type="text", text="Failed to get forecast URL from grid point data")]

                # Get the forecast
                forecast_data = await make_nws_request(client, forecast_url)
                
                if not forecast_data:
                    return [types.TextContent(type="text", text="Failed to retrieve forecast data")]

                # Format the forecast periods
                periods = forecast_data.get("properties", {}).get("periods", [])
                if not periods:
                    return [types.TextContent(type="text", text="No forecast periods available")]

                # Format each period into a concise string
                formatted_forecast = []
                for period in periods:
                    forecast_text = (
                        f"{period.get('name', 'Unknown')}:\n"
                        f"Temperature: {period.get('temperature', 'Unknown')}°{period.get('temperatureUnit', 'F')}\n"
                        f"Wind: {period.get('windSpeed', 'Unknown')} {period.get('windDirection', '')}\n"
                        f"{period.get('shortForecast', 'No forecast available')}\n"
                        "---"
                    )
                    formatted_forecast.append(forecast_text)

                forecast_text = f"Forecast for {latitude}, {longitude}:\n\n" + "\n".join(formatted_forecast)

                return [types.TextContent(
                    type="text",
                    text=forecast_text
                )]
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown tool: {name}")
    ```

    ### Running the server

    Finally, implement the main function to run the server:

    ```python
    async def main():
        # Run the server using stdin/stdout streams
        async with mcp.server.stdio.stdio_server() as (read_stream, write_stream):
            await server.run(
                read_stream,
                write_stream,
                InitializationOptions(
                    server_name="weather",
                    server_version="0.1.0",
                    capabilities=server.get_capabilities(
                        notification_options=NotificationOptions(),
                        experimental_capabilities={},
                    ),
                ),
            )

    # This is needed if you'd like to connect to a custom client
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    Your server is complete! Run `uv run src/weather/server.py` to confirm that everything's working.

    Let's now test your server from an existing MCP host, Claude for Desktop.

    ## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop

    <Note>
      Claude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux. Linux users can proceed to the [Building a client](/tutorials/building-a-client) tutorial to build an MCP client that connects to the server we just built.
    </Note>

    First, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. [You can install the latest version here.](https://claude.ai/download)

    Next, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor.

    For example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        ```bash
        code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```powershell
        code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Add this configuration (replace the parent folder path):

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        ```json Python
        {
            "mcpServers": {
                "weather": {
                    "command": "uv",
                    "args": [
                        "--directory",
                        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather",
                        "run",
                        "weather"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```json Python
        {
            "mcpServers": {
                "weather": {
                    "command": "uv",
                    "args": [
                        "--directory",
                        "C:\\ABSOLUTE\PATH\TO\PARENT\FOLDER\weather",
                        "run",
                        "weather"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    This tells Claude for Desktop:

    1.  There's an MCP server named "weather"
    2.  Launch it by running `uv --directory /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather run weather`

    Save the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Node">
    ### Prerequisite knowledge

    This quickstart assumes you have familiarity with:

    *   TypeScript
    *   LLMs like Claude

    ### System requirements

    For TypeScript, make sure you have the latest version of Node installed.

    ### Set up your environment

    First, let's install Node.js and npm if you haven't already. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
    Verify your Node.js installation:

    ```bash
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```

    For this tutorial, you'll need Node.js version 16 or higher.

    Now, let's create and set up our project:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash MacOS/Linux
      # Create a new directory for our project
      mkdir weather
      cd weather

      # Initialize a new npm project
      npm init -y

      # Install dependencies
      npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod
      npm install -D @types/node typescript

      # Create our files
      mkdir src
      touch src/index.ts
      ```

      ```powershell Windows
      # Create a new directory for our project
      md weather
      cd weather

      # Initialize a new npm project
      npm init -y

      # Install dependencies
      npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk zod
      npm install -D @types/node typescript

      # Create our files
      md src
      new-item src\index.ts
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Update your package.json to add type: "module" and a build script:

    ```json package.json
    {
      "type": "module",
      "bin": {
        "weather": "./build/index.js"
      },
      "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc && node -e \"require('fs').chmodSync('build/index.js', '755')\"",
      },
      "files": [
        "build"
      ],
    }
    ```

    Create a `tsconfig.json` in the root of your project:

    ```json tsconfig.json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "ES2022",
        "module": "Node16",
        "moduleResolution": "Node16",
        "outDir": "./build",
        "rootDir": "./src",
        "strict": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
      },
      "include": ["src/**/*"],
      "exclude": ["node_modules"]
    }
    ```

    Now let's dive into building your server.

    ## Building your server

    ### Importing packages

    Add these to the top of your `src/index.ts`:

    ```typescript
    import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";
    import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
    import {
      CallToolRequestSchema,
      ListToolsRequestSchema,
    } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js";
    import { z } from "zod";
    ```

    ### Setting up the instance

    Then initialize the NWS API base URL, validation schemas, and server instance:

    ```typescript
    const NWS_API_BASE = "https://api.weather.gov";
    const USER_AGENT = "weather-app/1.0";

    // Define Zod schemas for validation
    const AlertsArgumentsSchema = z.object({
      state: z.string().length(2),
    });

    const ForecastArgumentsSchema = z.object({
      latitude: z.number().min(-90).max(90),
      longitude: z.number().min(-180).max(180),
    });

    // Create server instance
    const server = new Server(
      {
        name: "weather",
        version: "1.0.0",
      },
      {
        capabilities: {
          tools: {},
        },
      }
    );
    ```

    ### Implementing tool listing

    We need to tell clients what tools are available. This `server.setRequestHandler` call will register this list for us:

    ```typescript
    // List available tools
    server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {
      return {
        tools: [
          {
            name: "get-alerts",
            description: "Get weather alerts for a state",
            inputSchema: {
              type: "object",
              properties: {
                state: {
                  type: "string",
                  description: "Two-letter state code (e.g. CA, NY)",
                },
              },
              required: ["state"],
            },
          },
          {
            name: "get-forecast",
            description: "Get weather forecast for a location",
            inputSchema: {
              type: "object",
              properties: {
                latitude: {
                  type: "number",
                  description: "Latitude of the location",
                },
                longitude: {
                  type: "number",
                  description: "Longitude of the location",
                },
              },
              required: ["latitude", "longitude"],
            },
          },
        ],
      };
    });
    ```

    This defines our two tools: `get-alerts` and `get-forecast`.

    ### Helper functions

    Next, let's add our helper functions for querying and formatting the data from the National Weather Service API:

    ```typescript
    // Helper function for making NWS API requests
    async function makeNWSRequest<T>(url: string): Promise<T | null> {
      const headers = {
        "User-Agent": USER_AGENT,
        Accept: "application/geo+json",
      };

      try {
        const response = await fetch(url, { headers });
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        return (await response.json()) as T;
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error making NWS request:", error);
        return null;
      }
    }

    interface AlertFeature {
      properties: {
        event?: string;
        areaDesc?: string;
        severity?: string;
        status?: string;
        headline?: string;
      };
    }

    // Format alert data
    function formatAlert(feature: AlertFeature): string {
      const props = feature.properties;
      return [
        `Event: ${props.event || "Unknown"}`,
        `Area: ${props.areaDesc || "Unknown"}`,
        `Severity: ${props.severity || "Unknown"}`,
        `Status: ${props.status || "Unknown"}`,
        `Headline: ${props.headline || "No headline"}`,
        "---",
      ].join("\n");
    }

    interface ForecastPeriod {
      name?: string;
      temperature?: number;
      temperatureUnit?: string;
      windSpeed?: string;
      windDirection?: string;
      shortForecast?: string;
    }

    interface AlertsResponse {
      features: AlertFeature[];
    }

    interface PointsResponse {
      properties: {
        forecast?: string;
      };
    }

    interface ForecastResponse {
      properties: {
        periods: ForecastPeriod[];
      };
    }
    ```

    ### Implementing tool execution

    The tool execution handler is responsible for actually executing the logic of each tool. Let's add it:

    ```typescript
    // Handle tool execution
    server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {
      const { name, arguments: args } = request.params;

      try {
        if (name === "get-alerts") {
          const { state } = AlertsArgumentsSchema.parse(args);
          const stateCode = state.toUpperCase();

          const alertsUrl = `${NWS_API_BASE}/alerts?area=${stateCode}`;
          const alertsData = await makeNWSRequest<AlertsResponse>(alertsUrl);

          if (!alertsData) {
            return {
              content: [
                {
                  type: "text",
                  text: "Failed to retrieve alerts data",
                },
              ],
            };
          }

          const features = alertsData.features || [];
          if (features.length === 0) {
            return {
              content: [
                {
                  type: "text",
                  text: `No active alerts for ${stateCode}`,
                },
              ],
            };
          }

          const formattedAlerts = features.map(formatAlert).slice(0, 20) // only take the first 20 alerts;
          const alertsText = `Active alerts for ${stateCode}:\n\n${formattedAlerts.join(
            "\n"
          )}`;

          return {
            content: [
              {
                type: "text",
                text: alertsText,
              },
            ],
          };
        } else if (name === "get-forecast") {
          const { latitude, longitude } = ForecastArgumentsSchema.parse(args);

          // Get grid point data
          const pointsUrl = `${NWS_API_BASE}/points/${latitude.toFixed(
            4
          )},${longitude.toFixed(4)}`;
          const pointsData = await makeNWSRequest<PointsResponse>(pointsUrl);

          if (!pointsData) {
            return {
              content: [
                {
                  type: "text",
                  text: `Failed to retrieve grid point data for coordinates: ${latitude}, ${longitude}. This location may not be supported by the NWS API (only US locations are supported).`,
                },
              ],
            };
          }

          const forecastUrl = pointsData.properties?.forecast;
          if (!forecastUrl) {
            return {
              content: [
                {
                  type: "text",
                  text: "Failed to get forecast URL from grid point data",
                },
              ],
            };
          }

          // Get forecast data
          const forecastData = await makeNWSRequest<ForecastResponse>(forecastUrl);
          if (!forecastData) {
            return {
              content: [
                {
                  type: "text",
                  text: "Failed to retrieve forecast data",
                },
              ],
            };
          }

          const periods = forecastData.properties?.periods || [];
          if (periods.length === 0) {
            return {
              content: [
                {
                  type: "text",
                  text: "No forecast periods available",
                },
              ],
            };
          }

          // Format forecast periods
          const formattedForecast = periods.map((period: ForecastPeriod) =>
            [
              `${period.name || "Unknown"}:`,
              `Temperature: ${period.temperature || "Unknown"}°${
                period.temperatureUnit || "F"
              }`,
              `Wind: ${period.windSpeed || "Unknown"} ${
                period.windDirection || ""
              }`,
              `${period.shortForecast || "No forecast available"}`,
              "---",
            ].join("\n")
          );

          const forecastText = `Forecast for ${latitude}, ${longitude}:\n\n${formattedForecast.join(
            "\n"
          )}`;

          return {
            content: [
              {
                type: "text",
                text: forecastText,
              },
            ],
          };
        } else {
          throw new Error(`Unknown tool: ${name}`);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {
          throw new Error(
            `Invalid arguments: ${error.errors
              .map((e) => `${e.path.join(".")}: ${e.message}`)
              .join(", ")}`
          );
        }
        throw error;
      }
    });
    ```

    ### Running the server

    Finally, implement the main function to run the server:

    ```typescript
    // Start the server
    async function main() {
      const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
      await server.connect(transport);
      console.error("Weather MCP Server running on stdio");
    }

    main().catch((error) => {
      console.error("Fatal error in main():", error);
      process.exit(1);
    });
    ```

    Make sure to run `npm run build` to build your server! This is a very important step in getting your server to connect.

    Let's now test your server from an existing MCP host, Claude for Desktop.

    ## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop

    <Note>
      Unfortunately, Claude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux. Linux users can proceed to the [Building a client](/tutorials/building-a-client) tutorial for a workaround.
    </Note>

    First, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. [You can install the latest version here.](https://claude.ai/download)

    Next, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor.

    For example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        ```bash
        code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```powershell
        code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Add this configuration (replace the parent folder path):

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="MacOS/Linux">
        <CodeGroup>
          ```json Node 
          {
              "mcpServers": {
                  "weather": {
                      "command": "node",
                      "args": [
                          "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather/build/index.js"
                      ]
                  }
              }
          }
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Windows">
        <CodeGroup>
          ```json Node
          {
              "mcpServers": {
                  "weather": {
                      "command": "node",
                      "args": [
                          "C:\\PATH\TO\PARENT\FOLDER\weather\build\index.js"
                      ]
                  }
              }
          }
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    This tells Claude for Desktop:

    1.  There's an MCP server named "weather"
    2.  Launch it by running `node /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather/build/index.js`

    Save the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Test with commands

First, make sure Claude for Desktop is picking up the two tools we've exposed in our `weather` server. You can do this by looking for the hammer <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/claude-desktop-mcp-hammer-icon.svg" style={{display: 'inline', margin: 0, height: '1.3em'}} /> icon:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/visual-indicator-mcp-tools.png" />
</Frame>

After clicking on the hammer icon, you should see two tools listed:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/available-mcp-tools.png" />
</Frame>

If your server isn't being picked up by Claude for Desktop, proceed to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for debugging advice.

You can now test your server by running the following commands in Claude for Desktop:

*   What's the weather in Sacramento?
*   What are the active weather alerts in Texas?

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/current-weather.png" />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/weather-alerts.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Since this is the US National Weather service, the queries will only work for US locations.
</Note>

## What's happening under the hood

When you ask a question:

1.  The client sends your question to Claude
2.  Claude analyzes the available tools and decides which one(s) to use
3.  The client executes the chosen tool(s) through the MCP server
4.  The results are sent back to Claude
5.  Claude formulates a natural language response
6.  The response is displayed to you!

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Weather API Issues">
    **Error: Failed to retrieve grid point data**

    This usually means either:

    1.  The coordinates are outside the US
    2.  The NWS API is having issues
    3.  You're being rate limited

    Fix:

    *   Verify you're using US coordinates
    *   Add a small delay between requests
    *   Check the NWS API status page

    **Error: No active alerts for \[STATE]**

    This isn't an error - it just means there are no current weather alerts for that state. Try a different state or check during severe weather.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Claude for Desktop Integration Issues">
    **Server not showing up in Claude**

    1.  Check your configuration file syntax
    2.  Make sure the path to your project is correct
    3.  Restart Claude for Desktop completely

    You can also check Claude's logs for errors like so:

    ```bash
    # Check Claude's logs for errors
    tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
    ```

    **Tool calls failing silently**

    If Claude attempts to use the tools but they fail:

    1.  Check Claude's logs for errors
    2.  Verify your server runs without errors
    3.  Try restarting Claude for Desktop
  </Accordion>

# Building MCP clients

Learn how to build your first client in MCP

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a LLM-powered chatbot client that connects to MCP servers. It helps to have gone through the [Quickstart tutorial](/quickstart) that guides you through the basic of building your first server.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    You can find the complete code for this tutorial [here.](https://gist.github.com/zckly/f3f28ea731e096e53b39b47bf0a2d4b1)

    ## System Requirements

    Before starting, ensure your system meets these requirements:

    *   Mac or Windows computer
    *   Latest Python version installed
    *   Latest version of `uv` installed

    ## Setting Up Your Environment

    First, create a new Python project with `uv`:

    ```bash
    # Create project directory
    uv init mcp-client
    cd mcp-client

    # Create virtual environment
    uv venv

    # Activate virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    # On Unix or MacOS:
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install required packages
    uv add mcp anthropic python-dotenv

    # Remove boilerplate files
    rm hello.py

    # Create our main file
    touch client.py
    ```

    ## Setting Up Your API Key

    You'll need an Anthropic API key from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

    Create a `.env` file to store it:

    ```bash
    # Create .env file
    touch .env
    ```

    Add your key to the `.env` file:

    ```bash
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your key here>
    ```

    Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`:

    ```bash
    echo ".env" >> .gitignore
    ```

    <Warning>
      Make sure you keep your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secure!
    </Warning>

    ## Creating the Client

    ### Basic Client Structure

    First, let's set up our imports and create the basic client class:

    ```python
    import asyncio
    from typing import Optional
    from contextlib import AsyncExitStack

    from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
    from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

    from anthropic import Anthropic
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    load_dotenv()  # load environment variables from .env

    class MCPClient:
        def __init__(self):
            # Initialize session and client objects
            self.session: Optional[ClientSession] = None
            self.exit_stack = AsyncExitStack()
            self.anthropic = Anthropic()
        # methods will go here
    ```

    ### Server Connection Management

    Next, we'll implement the method to connect to an MCP server:

    ```python
    async def connect_to_server(self, server_script_path: str):
        """Connect to an MCP server
        
        Args:
            server_script_path: Path to the server script (.py or .js)
        """
        is_python = server_script_path.endswith('.py')
        is_js = server_script_path.endswith('.js')
        if not (is_python or is_js):
            raise ValueError("Server script must be a .py or .js file")
            
        command = "python" if is_python else "node"
        server_params = StdioServerParameters(
            command=command,
            args=[server_script_path],
            env=None
        )
        
        stdio_transport = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(stdio_client(server_params))
        self.stdio, self.write = stdio_transport
        self.session = await self.exit_stack.enter_async_context(ClientSession(self.stdio, self.write))
        
        await self.session.initialize()
        
        # List available tools
        response = await self.session.list_tools()
        tools = response.tools
        print("\nConnected to server with tools:", [tool.name for tool in tools])
    ```

    ### Query Processing Logic

    Now let's add the core functionality for processing queries and handling tool calls:

    ```python
    async def process_query(self, query: str) -> str:
        """Process a query using Claude and available tools"""
        messages = [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": query
            }
        ]

        response = await self.session.list_tools()
        available_tools = [{ 
            "name": tool.name,
            "description": tool.description,
            "input_schema": tool.inputSchema
        } for tool in response.tools]

        # Initial Claude API call
        response = self.anthropic.messages.create(
            model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
            max_tokens=1000,
            messages=messages,
            tools=available_tools
        )

        # Process response and handle tool calls
        tool_results = []
        final_text = []

        for content in response.content:
            if content.type == 'text':
                final_text.append(content.text)
            elif content.type == 'tool_use':
                tool_name = content.name
                tool_args = content.input
                
                # Execute tool call
                result = await self.session.call_tool(tool_name, tool_args)
                tool_results.append({"call": tool_name, "result": result})
                final_text.append(f"[Calling tool {tool_name} with args {tool_args}]")

                # Continue conversation with tool results
                if hasattr(content, 'text') and content.text:
                    messages.append({
                      "role": "assistant",
                      "content": content.text
                    })
                messages.append({
                    "role": "user", 
                    "content": result.content
                })

                # Get next response from Claude
                response = self.anthropic.messages.create(
                    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
                    max_tokens=1000,
                    messages=messages,
                )

                final_text.append(response.content[0].text)

        return "\n".join(final_text)
    ```

    ### Interactive Chat Interface

    Now we'll add the chat loop and cleanup functionality:

    ```python
    async def chat_loop(self):
        """Run an interactive chat loop"""
        print("\nMCP Client Started!")
        print("Type your queries or 'quit' to exit.")
        
        while True:
            try:
                query = input("\nQuery: ").strip()
                
                if query.lower() == 'quit':
                    break
                    
                response = await self.process_query(query)
                print("\n" + response)
                    
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"\nError: {str(e)}")

    async def cleanup(self):
        """Clean up resources"""
        await self.exit_stack.aclose()
    ```

    ### Main Entry Point

    Finally, we'll add the main execution logic:

    ```python
    async def main():
        if len(sys.argv) < 2:
            print("Usage: python client.py <path_to_server_script>")
            sys.exit(1)
            
        client = MCPClient()
        try:
            await client.connect_to_server(sys.argv[1])
            await client.chat_loop()
        finally:
            await client.cleanup()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import sys
        asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    You can find the complete `client.py` file [here.](https://gist.github.com/zckly/f3f28ea731e096e53b39b47bf0a2d4b1)

    ## Key Components Explained

    ### 1. Client Initialization

    *   The `MCPClient` class initializes with session management and API clients
    *   Uses `AsyncExitStack` for proper resource management
    *   Configures the Anthropic client for Claude interactions

    ### 2. Server Connection

    *   Supports both Python and Node.js servers
    *   Validates server script type
    *   Sets up proper communication channels
    *   Initializes the session and lists available tools

    ### 3. Query Processing

    *   Maintains conversation context
    *   Handles Claude's responses and tool calls
    *   Manages the message flow between Claude and tools
    *   Combines results into a coherent response

    ### 4. Interactive Interface

    *   Provides a simple command-line interface
    *   Handles user input and displays responses
    *   Includes basic error handling
    *   Allows graceful exit

    ### 5. Resource Management

    *   Proper cleanup of resources
    *   Error handling for connection issues
    *   Graceful shutdown procedures

    ## Common Customization Points

    1.  **Tool Handling**
        *   Modify `process_query()` to handle specific tool types
        *   Add custom error handling for tool calls
        *   Implement tool-specific response formatting

    2.  **Response Processing**
        *   Customize how tool results are formatted
        *   Add response filtering or transformation
        *   Implement custom logging

    3.  **User Interface**
        *   Add a GUI or web interface
        *   Implement rich console output
        *   Add command history or auto-completion

    ## Running the Client

    To run your client with any MCP server:

    ```bash
    uv run client.py path/to/server.py # python server
    uv run client.py path/to/build/index.js # node server
    ```

    <Note>
      If you're continuing the weather tutorial from the quickstart, your command might look something like this: `python client.py .../weather/src/weather/server.py`
    </Note>

    The client will:

    1.  Connect to the specified server
    2.  List available tools
    3.  Start an interactive chat session where you can:
        *   Enter queries
        *   See tool executions
        *   Get responses from Claude

    Here's an example of what it should look like if connected to the weather server from the quickstart:

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/client-claude-cli-python.png" />
    </Frame>

    ## How It Works

    When you submit a query:

    1.  The client gets the list of available tools from the server
    2.  Your query is sent to Claude along with tool descriptions
    3.  Claude decides which tools (if any) to use
    4.  The client executes any requested tool calls through the server
    5.  Results are sent back to Claude
    6.  Claude provides a natural language response
    7.  The response is displayed to you

    ## Best practices

    1.  **Error Handling**
        *   Always wrap tool calls in try-catch blocks
        *   Provide meaningful error messages
        *   Gracefully handle connection issues

    2.  **Resource Management**
        *   Use `AsyncExitStack` for proper cleanup
        *   Close connections when done
        *   Handle server disconnections

    3.  **Security**
        *   Store API keys securely in `.env`
        *   Validate server responses
        *   Be cautious with tool permissions

    ## Troubleshooting

    ### Server Path Issues

    *   Double-check the path to your server script is correct
    *   Use the absolute path if the relative path isn't working
    *   For Windows users, make sure to use forward slashes (/) or escaped backslashes (\\) in the path
    *   Verify the server file has the correct extension (.py for Python or .js for Node.js)

    Example of correct path usage:

    ```bash
    # Relative path
    uv run client.py ./server/weather.py

    # Absolute path
    uv run client.py /Users/username/projects/mcp-server/weather.py

    # Windows path (either format works)
    uv run client.py C:/projects/mcp-server/weather.py
    uv run client.py C:\\projects\\mcp-server\\weather.py
    ```

    ### Response Timing

    *   The first response might take up to 30 seconds to return
    *   This is normal and happens while:
        *   The server initializes
        *   Claude processes the query
        *   Tools are being executed
    *   Subsequent responses are typically faster
    *   Don't interrupt the process during this initial waiting period

    ### Common Error Messages

    If you see:

    *   `FileNotFoundError`: Check your server path
    *   `Connection refused`: Ensure the server is running and the path is correct
    *   `Tool execution failed`: Verify the tool's required environment variables are set
    *   `Timeout error`: Consider increasing the timeout in your client configuration

# Building MCP with LLMs

Speed up your MCP development using LLMs such as Claude!

This guide will help you use LLMs to help you build custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients. We'll be focusing on Claude for this tutorial, but you can do this with any frontier LLM.

## Preparing the documentation

Before starting, gather the necessary documentation to help Claude understand MCP:

1.  Visit [https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt) and copy the full documentation text
2.  Navigate to either the [MCP TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) or [Python SDK repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
3.  Copy the README files and other relevant documentation
4.  Paste these documents into your conversation with Claude

## Describing your server

Once you've provided the documentation, clearly describe to Claude what kind of server you want to build. Be specific about:

*   What resources your server will expose
*   What tools it will provide
*   Any prompts it should offer
*   What external systems it needs to interact with

For example:

```
Build an MCP server that:
- Connects to my company's PostgreSQL database
- Exposes table schemas as resources
- Provides tools for running read-only SQL queries
- Includes prompts for common data analysis tasks
```

## Working with Claude

When working with Claude on MCP servers:

1.  Start with the core functionality first, then iterate to add more features
2.  Ask Claude to explain any parts of the code you don't understand
3.  Request modifications or improvements as needed
4.  Have Claude help you test the server and handle edge cases

Claude can help implement all the key MCP features:

*   Resource management and exposure
*   Tool definitions and implementations
*   Prompt templates and handlers
*   Error handling and logging
*   Connection and transport setup

## Best practices

When building MCP servers with Claude:

*   Break down complex servers into smaller pieces
*   Test each component thoroughly before moving on
*   Keep security in mind - validate inputs and limit access appropriately
*   Document your code well for future maintenance
*   Follow MCP protocol specifications carefully

## Next steps

After Claude helps you build your server:

1.  Review the generated code carefully
2.  Test the server with the MCP Inspector tool
3.  Connect it to Claude.app or other MCP clients
4.  Iterate based on real usage and feedback

Remember that Claude can help you modify and improve your server as requirements change over time.
